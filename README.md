# JobInterviewAlgorithms
A library of classic algorithms that you will find **very** useful to study when interviewing for your next software engineering job.

It consists of directories that contain classic job interview algorithms from all the top tech companies. Inside each folder there will be
files that coincide with different programming languages' solutions. If you would like to write a new algorithm, or possibly add a new
solution in a different language, feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/AustinTice/JobInterviewAlgorithms/pulls).
