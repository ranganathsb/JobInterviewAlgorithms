# Recursive Linear Search
**Problem Definition:** 
Define a recursive function that, as input, takes an array and a search value and returns the index where it's first found in the array. Return -1 if the value is not found.

---
**Examples:**
* `arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`
* recSearch(arr, 8, ..your choice of params..) => 5
* recSearch(arr, 1, ..your choice of params..) => 0

---
**Notes:**
In this program seek to find the most optimal recursive algorithm to do this search. Choosing meaningful parameters is a good start.
